# Data-Planet

Domain Scientists perform a range on experiments on different ML procedures. Currently, the workflow involves manually performing operations like data ETL, model training, selection, validation. Additionally management of datasets and model configuration itself is a huge overhead. We create a unified platform that encapsulates these procedures and automates this pipeline, by integrating two robust frameworks MLFlow and Dataverse into a platform called dataplanet. MLFlow provides a streamlined way to automate the machine learning workflow and makes model versioning, packing and tracking feasible. Whereas, Dataverse is a dataset management tool where datasets and their associated metadatas can be stored along with inbuilt version control. Dataplanet makes experiment and data management effortless and also provides one-click reproducibility, thus making ML even more accessible.
